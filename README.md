# Keybox

Features:
- [x] Encrypted password storage
- [x] Multiple vaults to organize credentials
- [x] Per-vault colorschemes
- [x] Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- [x] Automatic display scaling 
- [x] Password delete confirmation

Maybe I'll implement some form of cloud syncing in the future, but for now just working with the vault file manually should be fine.
